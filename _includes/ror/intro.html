  workshop introduces the challanges in reproducibility and transparent, reproducible and open
  research principles.

  Transparency, open sharing, and reproducibility are core values of science, but not always part of daily
  practice. This workshop provides an overview of current status in reproducible analysis in order to
  provide transparency in research. The workshop covers the use of version controll, collboration,
  literate programming with Jupyter Notebooks and publishing the code in citable way. Going beyond simple
